        <p id="text">Student – 'Good morning!'<br>
            Librarian – 'Hello! Are you looking for a book in particular?'<br>
            Student – 'I'm looking for a specific book titled 'Animal Psycholog'. Unfortunately I couldn't find it
            anywhere in the psychology section.'<br>
            Librarian – 'I see. Have you already used the computer terminal on this floor?'<br>
            Student – 'I have, in fact. The book is listed in this section but I didn't find it on the shelves. There
            are DVDs related to the subject, but I need the book.'<br>
            Librarian – 'Just a moment, please. Let me check... Well, yes. The book is in our database but somebody has
            checked it out recently.'<br>
            Student – 'Oh. Don't you have another copy of it?'<br>
            Librarian – 'No. Sorry. We have only one copy. And it should be available in 7 days.'<br>
            Student – 'So, I can check again next Tuesday, right?'<br>
            Librarian – 'That's right. But you can look for some other books today if you want. Do you have a library
            card?'<br>
            Student – 'No, I don't. I want to sign up for it. What do I need for that?'<br>
            Librarian – 'You have to submit a photo identification and proof of residence. When you find the book you'd
            like to check out, bring it to the front desk and I'll explain you how to fill out the library card.'<br>
            Student – 'OK. How long may I have the books checked out?'<br>
            Librarian – 'You can have our books for 10 days.'<br>
            Student – 'And how much is the fine after that?'<br>
            Librarian – 'According to our rules, you'll be charged 20 cents every day you don't return it after 10
            days.'<br>
            Student – 'I see. Thanks a lot. I'll browse what is available.'<br>
